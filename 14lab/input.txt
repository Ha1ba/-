once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a small village. she had a very happy life, and she loved to play with her friends.
one day, the little girl was playing in the forest when she came across a strange creature. the creature was small and furry, with big eyes and a long tail.
the little girl was scared at first, but the creature seemed friendly. it came up to her and licked her hand.
the little girl smiled and petted the creature. she named it "fuzzy," and they became best friends.
